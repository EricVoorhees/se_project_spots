### Project Name: Spots     Eric Voorhees

#about

#This is social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make changes to their own profile.

It was built with HTML, and CSS. The next functionality i will add will make the
site fully functional allowing you to post pictures, edit your profile, and edit pre-existing posts. I will also add an animation that makes the heart move when selected.

#the link for the project is below
